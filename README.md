3D Music Visualizer with Audio-Driven Terrain Generation

This project creates a real-time 3D terrain mesh animation using OpenGL, where the terrain is dynamically influenced by incoming audio signals. The terrain's shape is generated by combining Perlin noise with live audio input to create a unique music visualizer effect.
Features

1. Audio-Driven Terrain

    The terrain mesh dynamically changes its shape based on live audio input captured from your microphone or other input devices.
    The PyAudio library is used to capture audio data in real-time. This audio data influences the z-axis (height) of the terrain vertices, creating peaks and valleys based on the audio signal.
    The audio input is processed in chunks, which allows the mesh to respond to different frequencies and intensities of sound in a visually compelling way.

2. Perlin Noise Integration

    The terrain is also modified by Perlin noise, generated using the OpenSimplex noise algorithm.
    The Perlin noise provides a smooth, continuous, and organic variation across the terrain, ensuring that even in the absence of sound, the terrain has a dynamic and interesting shape.
    The noise values are calculated based on the x and y coordinates of the mesh, with a small offset that moves over time, creating a continuous flowing effect.

3. Real-Time Visualization

    The terrain is rendered using the PyQtGraph library's OpenGL widget (GLViewWidget), allowing for smooth 3D visualization.
    The application runs in real-time, updating the terrain as the audio input and noise values change, giving a fluid, evolving look that corresponds to the input sound.

Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

    NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
    OpenSimplex: For generating Perlin noise used in the terrain mesh.
    PyQt5: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
    PyQtGraph: For handling 3D visualization with OpenGL.
    PyAudio: For capturing and processing real-time audio input.

You can install all dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install numpy opensimplex pyqt5 pyqtgraph pyaudio

How to Run

    Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

    Make sure your audio input device (e.g., microphone) is working. The program uses PyAudio to capture live audio and adjust the terrain in real-time.

    Run the script:

bash

python3 terrain_visualizer.py

    A new window should open, displaying a 3D grid that represents the terrain. As you play music, speak into your microphone, or generate any other audio input, the terrain will shift and morph according to the sound.

    Interaction with the terrain:
        You can rotate the 3D view by clicking and dragging the mouse.
        The terrain will continuously update as the sound changes, combined with the Perlin noise to create a fluid and dynamic effect.

Key Components

    Terrain Mesh: The terrain is constructed using a grid of vertices, where each vertex's z-value is influenced by both the Perlin noise and the audio data.
    PyAudio Stream: Audio data is continuously read in chunks and processed to modify the terrain mesh.
    OpenSimplex Noise: Perlin noise is used to provide additional variation and natural-looking patterns in the terrain.
    3D Visualization: PyQtGraph's GLMeshItem is used to render the terrain in a 3D view, with options to interact with and view the terrain from different angles.

Troubleshooting

    No Audio Input: Ensure that your audio input device (microphone) is working and that PyAudio has the correct permissions to access it.
    Performance Issues: If the visualization runs slowly, try reducing the resolution of the terrain mesh by decreasing the number of vertices in the x and y directions.

Future Improvements

    Add support for more advanced audio features such as FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for frequency-based visualization.
    Provide more customization options for the terrain, such as adjusting the Perlin noise intensity or modifying the color palette.
